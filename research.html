      <h2>Effects of pack stock grazing on subalpine meadows and streams: </h2>
      <small>Funding: National Park Service J8R07080005, J8C07100004,

      <p>Comparisons of persisting versus annual effects of a given long-term
        disturbance are less common than might be expected.&nbsp; Grazing
        management provides a good laboratory for such studies, because of
        detailed, long-term stock use records and the presence of <em>de
          facto</em> long-term exclosures. Pack stock grazing in the subalpine
        wetlands of Sequoia, Kings Canyon, and Yosemite National Parks, in the
        Sierra Nevada mountains of California, presents an interesting
        disturbance regime, in that there are short pulses of disturbance,
        followed by long periods of winter recovery that persist for about nine
        months while these wet meadows lie under several meters of snow. The
        primary objective of this component of our work was to compare long-term
        and annual effects of pack stock grazing on arthropods and vegetation,
        and this disturbance regime allowed us to establish a long-term and
        large-scale experiment designed to accomplish this goal.&nbsp; We
        sampled after meadow greenup, but just before stock grazing, and also
        after wetlands had been grazed by stock for most of the growing season,
        but just before vegetation senescence.&nbsp; This design, using paired
        ungrazed and grazed wetlands, allows us to separate long-term effects,
        that carry over through many winter recovery periods, from short-term,
        current-year effects that might be caused by stock during individual
        growing/grazing seasons. (S Haultain photo)</p>


      <p>Grazing management necessarily emphasizes the most spatially extensive
        vegetation assemblages, but landscapes are mosaics, often with more
        mesic vegetation types embedded within a matrix of dryer vegetation. We
        are thus also contrasting effects of equine grazing, on both subalpine
        vegetation structure and associated arthropods, in a dryer reed grass
        dominated habitat versus a wetter, more productive, sedge habitat.</p>

      <p>This work effectively addresses effects at the landscape scale but has
        the potential to underestimate effects at the patch scale. We are
        comparing heavily-grazed patches with areas of lesser use within
        individual wetlands—and with reference wetlands-- in order to detect
        maximum levels of impact at smaller scales. </p>
      <p>Stock cross streams throughout the Sierra, and an additional component
        of our work is an investigation of potential effects on streams via
        nutrient input and sedimentation.  We are sampling above and below
        replicate stream fords in early and late season to determine effects on
        stream macroinvertebrate assemblages, algal characteristics, and
        detrital deposition. </p>

      <h2>Influence of invasive palms on terrestrial arthropod assemblages in
        desert spring habitat</h2>

          invasive palms</a>.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Invasive plants can eliminate native flora and ultimately have negative
        indirect effects on fauna and the functional ecology of ecosystems, but
        understanding of these cascading effects on arthropod assemblages is
        poor.  Desert spring habitats are small, isolated landscape elements
        that are literal oases for flora and fauna and support high diversity
        assemblages; invasive palms can colonize desert springs and form
        monocultures. In an effort to understand effects of these invasive trees
        on higher terrestrial trophic levels at springs, we are contrasting
        assemblage structure of terrestrial arthropods in native vegetation
        versus invasive palm habitat.  We are vacuum sampling arthropods in
        paired palm and native habitat at replicate springs in Death Valley
        National Park, California, across multiple growing seasons, both before
        and after Park Service palm removal efforts.  (J Schmidt-Gengenbach

      <h2>Efficacy of low and high complexity restoration treatments for
        reestablishing assemblage structure of wetland arthropods in a montane
        ecosystem</h2>

          P12AC10901</small></p>

      <p>The ultimate goal of restoration is re-creation of ecological function,
        versus achieving a targeted plant density or general appearance.
        Restoration inherently alters the meso-landscape, and the nature of
        these changes to landscape configuration may have important influences
        on faunal reassembly. Habitat heterogeneity (compositional differences
        among patches) and complexity (density of structural components), shape
        invertebrate assemblage structure and may be especially important during
        restoration. Increasing connectivity via reduced patch boundary contrast
        or provision of corridors might be expected to increase recolonization
        of restored habitats. Our objectives were to: 1) assess recovery rate of
        the arthropod assemblage to wetland restoration in the harsh montane
        environment of Sequoia National Park, 2) assess faunal reassembly in
        dispersed plug plantings versus an additional treatment that
        incorporated additional heterogeneity, complexity, and connectance to
        source habitats.</p>

      <h2>Role of dam discharge characteristics in structuring aquatic

      <p>We have been able to use a series of experimental releases from the
        Hetch Hetchy reservoir in Yosemite National Park to investigate effects
        of spring floods on macroinvertebrates in both the river and nearby
        lentic habitats in the floodplain. Faunal samples are being collected at
        a number of locations before floods, immediately after floods, and over
        the ensuing months of each year in an effort to understand the complex
        ways in which fauna respond to these events. We have been tracking
        changes in faunal assemblage structure of riffle habitats, stream drift
        (both aquatic and terrestrial components), and in ephemeral ponds, which
        are inundated for as little as a few days or as long as five months. We
        are also sampling terrestrial insects, with both terrestrial and aquatic
        origins, in an effort to understand insect interactions with bird and
        bat predators. </p>
